For the Module 3 Project I built a Inventory manager.  At this time a lot of people have taken to running small business in an attempt to stay a float.  This maanger can serve as a way to keep track of their inventory from amount , brands purchased down to the location which makes it easier once the item is sold.
I used Postgres , Spring Boot with Maven, ReactJS, CSS, Bootstrap , MVC, and AJAX .
